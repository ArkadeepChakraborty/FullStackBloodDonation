# Blood Donation Website

This "Blood Donation Website" is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), where I used React.Js as a Frontend for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces for both Server site and Client Site. In Backend I used Node.js and Express creating robust APIs to handle user requests and interactions. In Database I used MongoDB Cluster for scalable and secure data storage. Mongoose for managing data schemas and interactions with the database. The aim is to provide a seamless platform for users to register as blood donors and for individuals in need of blood to search for donors based on specific criteria. In emergencies, users can quickly search for and contact suitable blood donors through the website. Here in the admin managed the Client site and website's components too.

Users can register themselves as blood donors by providing necessary details. Registered users can log in to their accounts to manage and edit their profiles to update their information.

Users can search for blood donors by specifying their local address and blood group which makes it easy for users to find the right match quickly.

In this project, I implemented OTP (One-Time Password) verification to overcome user's forgot password issue which enhances the security and reliability of the password recovery process.

Also I implemented hashing for passwords to ensure user data is securely stored and protect user credentials from unauthorized access.

Users can make request for blood to a donor and after doner's action he or she can understand if the blood request is accepted or not.  

To store the data of registered donors I used MongoDB Cluster to ensures scalability and reliability of the database to handle user registrations and search queries.

I implemented a Razorpay payment gateway to make secure financial contributions to support the platform or related causes through the integrated payment gateway.

Here, Admin can also handles users details, donors details, blood requests and the description section of the website. He can also handles his own profile too.
